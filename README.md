arduino drone for com sci


to do
--------
- make my own ish version of the getYPR.h file
- make my own ish version of the void setup() in the main file
- is it possible to setup the getYPR.h in another header file or another function in the getYPR.h file?
- make a header file for controlling the motors and stabilization
- make a header file for rf or wifi communication
    - either way I could make a python executable for raspberry pi to send wifi or rf
